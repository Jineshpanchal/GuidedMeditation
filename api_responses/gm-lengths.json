Designed for seasoned practitioners or those seeking transformation, these sessions allow the soul to rest in the Supreme abode — Paramdham — beyond karma, role, and sound. You’ll experience profound lightness, detachment, and soul-home remembrance. The longer you stay, the more power and purity you absorb."
